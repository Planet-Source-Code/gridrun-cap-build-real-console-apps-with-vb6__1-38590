### Description

Finally: CAP lets you create and compile "true" console applications with VB6. "True" as in: Not those cheesy things that open up a new console window! Instead, a console app made with CAP will run in a DOS console (or a cmd.exe session). See the included demo project (a "port" of the UNIX uname command). Did I mention that the included bas module supports STDIO and debugging in the VB IDE, with a console? There is also a short .txt file elaborating some more on the topic, too. Please vote if you find this useful, thank you!
